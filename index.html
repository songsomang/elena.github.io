      <h3 class="item-title">Sport Statistics and Predictions (Python, SQL)</h3>
      <p class="item-description">Developed a machine learning model for predicting sports match outcomes by collecting the European Soccer match database. Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify relevant patterns and relationships. Leveraged a diverse array of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and XGBoost to create a robust prediction model. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall with cross-validation to ensure reliability.</p>
